- **Title Matching**: Find papers by closest title match with confidence scoring
- **Batch Operations**: Retrieve multiple papers efficiently (up to 500 papers per request)

### üë• **Author Discovery & Analysis**

- Search authors by name or affiliation
- Retrieve detailed author profiles with metrics (h-index, citation counts, paper counts)
- Access complete publication lists for any author

### üìä **Citation Network Analysis**

- Explore papers that cite a specific work
- Analyze reference lists and citation patterns
- Multi-depth citation network traversal for comprehensive impact analysis
